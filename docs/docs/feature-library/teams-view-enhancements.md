The Teams View can be modified by adding and removing columns in the [WorkersDataTable](https://www.twilio.com/docs/flex/developer/ui/components#add-columns-to-workersdatatable).

The workers skills array can be re-formatted and shown in an additional column in the WorksDataTable of the Teams View.  This gives Supervisors a quicker way to review worker skills. Additionally, extra columns can be added to display worker attributes such as `team_name`, `department_name`, `location` or other custom attributes.
